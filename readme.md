# Line Out to the End of the Universe

A very short visual novel about finding the end of the universe.

Made in/for a Spring 2024 class.
This is changed minimally since I submitted it for class,
only adding a line to default the game to fullscreen
(which was always how I intended it to be played),
as well as removing unnecessary audio sliders in the preferences menu.
So it's basically the same.
